# Meteor Metadata Model

We have a set of defined metadata models which define the structure of metadata that meteor will yield.
To visit the metadata models being used by different extractors please visit [here](../reference/extractors.md).
We are currently using the following metadata models:

* [Bucket](Bucket.md)
* [Chart](Chart.md)
* [Dashboard](Dashboard.md)
* [Group](Group.md)
* [Job](Job.md)
* [Table](Table.md)
* [Topic](Topic.md)
* [User](User.md)

`Proto` has been used to define these metadata models.
To check their implementation please refer [here](../../proto/odpf/meta/README.md).
