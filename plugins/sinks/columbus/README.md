# Columbus

Columbus is a search and discovery engine built for querying application deployments, datasets and meta resources. It can also optionally track data flow relationships between these resources and allow the user to view a representation of the data flow graph.

## Usage

```yaml
sinks:
  name: columbus
  config:
    host: https://columbus.com
	  type: sample-columbus-type
    labels:
      myCustom: $properties.attributes.myCustomField
      sampleLabel: $properties.labels.sampleLabelField
```
