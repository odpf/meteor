# Metadata Models

Currently meteor provides the extracted metadata as one of the following metadata models:

* [Bucket](Bucket.pb.gp)
* [Chart](Chart.pb.go)
* [Dashboard](Dashboard.pb.go)
* [Group](Group.pb.go)
* [Job](Job.pb.go)
* [Table](Table.pb.go)
* [Topic](Topic.pb.go)
* [User](User.pb.go)

While adding an extractor one needs to provide metadata supported by these models. If you want some other data model added to the list feel free to raise a issue.
